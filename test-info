and transform their content using Spring Integration's message transformation 
capabilities.

?	Error handling and retry: Spring Integration provides built-in mechanisms for 
handling errors and retrying failed operations.

?	Integration with other modules: The file 

module can be easily integrated with other Spring Integration modules, such 
as JMS, HTTP, and FTP, to create complex integration scenarios.


Spring Integration's file module is a valuable tool for building robust and 
scalable file-based integration solutions. It provides a declarative approach, 
pollable endpoints, and integration with other modules, making it easy to 
integrate your applications with file systems and other storage systems.


2. Mapstruct 

MapStruct: A Code Generator for Mappings

MapStruct is a code generator that simplifies the creation of mappings 
between Java objects. It generates efficient mapping code at compile time, 
reducing boilerplate code and improving performance.

- What are some standards that were decided upon? 
Naming conventions: code, database collection/tables 
RESTful API conventions: versioning, URI path design, pagination


Slide 8 
- Monitoring stack 

Grafana Stack: Loki, Tempo, Prometheus

The Grafana stack is a popular combination of tools used for monitoring and 
observability. It consists of:

?	Loki: A horizontally scalable log aggregation and search system.

?	Tempo: A distributed tracing backend.


?	Prometheus: A time-series database and monitoring system.

Loki

?	Push-based model: Loki primarily uses a push-based model for ingesting 
logs. This means that applications or services send logs directly to Loki.

?	Promtail: A sidecar agent that can be deployed alongside applications to 
collect logs and forward them to Loki.

?	HTTP API: Applications can also send logs directly to Loki's HTTP API.

Tempo

Push-based model: Tempo also uses a push-based model for ingesting 
traces.

?	OpenTelemetry SDKs: Applications can use OpenTelemetry SDKs to 
instrument their code and generate traces. These traces are then sent to 
Tempo.

?	HTTP API: Tempo also provides an HTTP API for sending traces directly.

Prometheus

?	Pull-based model: Prometheus uses a pull-based model to collect metrics. 
This means that Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics from exposed HTTP 
endpoints on target applications.

?	Exporters: Applications can expose metrics using a variety of exporters, such 
as the Prometheus Pushgateway or custom exporters.

?	Service Discovery: Prometheus can use service discovery mechanisms to 
automatically discover new targets to scrape.

Key differences between push and pull models:

?	Push-based: Data is actively sent from the source (application or service) to 
the monitoring system. This can be more efficient for high-volume data.

?	Pull-based: The monitoring system actively fetches data from the source. This 
can be more flexible, as it allows for dynamic discovery of targets.

In summary, the Grafana stack combines the strengths of push and pull 
models to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and observability. 
Loki and Tempo use push-based models for ingesting logs and traces, while 
Prometheus uses a pull-based model for collecting metrics. This flexibility 
allows the stack to be adapted to various monitoring scenarios.

Slide 9 
- Microservice Architecture 

Microservice Architecture

Microservices architecture is a software development approach where a large 
complex application is broken down into smaller, independent services that 
communicate with each other using well-defined APIs. Each microservice 
focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, 
and scaled independently.   

Pros of Microservice Architecture:

?	Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on 
demand, improving overall system performance and resource utilization.
?	Resilience: If one microservice fails, the others can continue to function, 
reducing the risk of system-wide outages.
?	Flexibility: Microservices architecture allows for rapid development and 
deployment of new features, as each service can be updated and released 
independently.
?	Technology Agnostic: Different microservices can use different technologies 
and programming languages, providing flexibility in choosing the best tool for 
the job.
?	Team Autonomy: Development teams can work independently on different 
microservices, improving productivity and agility.

Cons of Microservice Architecture:

*	Complexity: Managing a large number of microservices can be complex, 
requiring careful coordination and communication between teams.

?	Distributed Systems Challenges: Microservices introduce challenges related 
to distributed systems, such as network latency, data consistency, and fault 
tolerance.

?	Increased Overhead: There is increased overhead associated with managing 
microservices, including network traffic, API calls, and service discovery.

?	Testing and Debugging: Testing and debugging microservices can be more 
challenging due to their distributed nature and dependencies on other 
services.

Workarounds for Tradeoffs:

?	Service Mesh: A service mesh can simplify the management of microservices 
by providing features such as service discovery, load balancing, and security.

?	API Gateways: API gateways can act as a single entry point for clients, 
handling tasks such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

?	Event-Driven Architecture: Using an event-driven architecture can help 
decouple microservices and improve scalability.

?	Domain-Driven Design (DDD): DDD can help break down a complex domain 
into smaller, bounded contexts, making it easier to design and manage 
microservices.

?	Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): CI/CD pipelines 
can automate the building, testing, and deployment of microservices, reducing 
the risk of errors and improving delivery speed.

By carefully considering the tradeoffs and implementing appropriate strategies, 
organizations can successfully leverage the benefits of microservice 
architecture while mitigating its challenges.

Slide 10: 
- Event driven 
How Event-Driven Architecture 

Solves Microservice Challenges

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a powerful approach that can address 
many of the challenges associated with microservices. Here's how:

Decoupling Microservices

?	Loose Coupling: EDA promotes loose coupling between microservices. 
Instead of directly calling each other, they publish events to a shared event 
bus. This reduces dependencies and makes the system more resilient to 
changes.

?	Asynchronous Communication: Events are typically processed 
asynchronously, allowing microservices to operate independently and scale 
independently.

Improved Scalability

?	Scalability: EDA can scale more efficiently because microservices only need 
to process events relevant to their functionality. This avoids unnecessary 
processing and resource consumption.

?	Horizontal Scaling: The event bus can be scaled horizontally to handle 
increased load, ensuring that the system remains responsive.

Enhanced Resilience

?	Fault Tolerance: If a microservice fails 
to process an event, it can be retried or handled by another microservice. This 
improves the system's resilience to failures.

?	Isolation: EDA can help isolate failures within a microservice, preventing them 
from affecting the entire system.

Simplified Development and Testing

?	Simplified Development: EDA can simplify development by making it easier 
to reason about the flow of data through the system.

?	Easier Testing: It's often easier to test individual microservices in isolation, as 
they are decoupled from each other.

Examples of Event-Driven Patterns

?	Publish-Subscribe: Microservices publish events to a topic, and other 
microservices subscribe to that topic to receive the events.

?	Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): CQRS separates 
read and write operations, often using event sourcing to store a sequence of 
events that represent the state of the system.

In summary, event-driven architecture is a valuable tool for building scalable, 
resilient, and loosely coupled microservices. By decoupling microservices and 
enabling 
asynchronous communication, EDA can help address many of the challenges 
associated with microservices.

take some time for developers who are new to ORMs.

Overall, MyBatis is a powerful and versatile ORM framework that can be a 
great choice for Java applications that need to interact with databases 
efficiently and flexibly.

- ORM: hibernate

Hibernate: A Popular ORM Framework

Hibernate is an open-source Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) framework for 
Java that provides a high-level API for interacting with databases. It automates 
many of the common tasks involved in database interactions, such as 
mapping Java objects to database tables and executing SQL queries.

Key Features:

?	Object-Relational Mapping: Hibernate maps Java classes to database 
tables, allowing you to work with objects instead of raw SQL.

?	Query Language: Hibernate uses its own query language, HQL (Hibernate 
Query Language), which is similar to SQL but provides additional features like 
object-oriented querying.

?	Caching: Hibernate provides built-in 
caching mechanisms to improve performance by storing frequently accessed 
data in memory.

?	Transactions: Hibernate manages transactions, ensuring data consistency 
and integrity.

?	Lazy Loading: Hibernate can defer the loading of associated objects until 
they are actually needed, improving performance in certain scenarios.

Pros of Using Hibernate:

applications.

Choosing Between Hibernate and JPA:

Hibernate is a JPA implementation, 

meaning it conforms to the Java Persistence API (JPA) standard. JPA is a 
specification that defines a set of interfaces for interacting with databases in 
Java applications.

If you need a powerful and flexible ORM framework with a rich feature set, 
Hibernate is a good choice. However, if you prefer a more standardized 
approach and want to be able to switch between different JPA 
implementations, JPA may be a better option.

Ultimately, the best choice for your project will depend on your specific 
requirements and preferences.

Hibernate's Performance Limitations in Bulk Processing
While Hibernate is a powerful ORM framework, it can sometimes encounter 
performance challenges when dealing with bulk processing operations. Here 
are some reasons why:

?	Object Creation Overhead: Hibernate creates Java objects for each row 
returned from a database query. This can be inefficient for large result sets, as 
it involves object instantiation and initialization.

?	SQL Generation Overhead: Hibernate generates SQL statements 
dynamically based on your mapping configuration. This can introduce 
overhead, especially for complex queries or large result sets.

?	Session Management: Hibernate maintains a session context, which can 
introduce overhead for large transactions or long-running processes.

?	Caching Limitations: While Hibernate's caching can improve performance, it 
may not be optimal for bulk processing scenarios, especially when dealing 
with large datasets or frequently changing data.

?	Batching Limitations: Hibernate's built-in batching mechanism can help 
improve performance for bulk inserts and updates, but it may not be as 
efficient as custom batching solutions.

Workarounds for Bulk Processing with Hibernate:

To address these limitations, you can consider the following strategies:


?	Native SQL: For bulk operations, you can use native SQL directly to avoid 
Hibernate's object creation and query generation overhead.

?	Batching: Implement custom batching mechanisms to group multiple 
operations into a single SQL statement, reducing the number of round trips to 
the database.

?	Bulk Updates: If you need to update a large number of rows, consider using 
bulk update statements directly instead of relying on Hibernate's object-
oriented approach.

?	Optimize Queries: Ensure that your SQL queries are optimized for 
performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.

?	Consider Alternatives: For highly performance-critical bulk processing 
scenarios, you might want to explore alternative frameworks or libraries that 
are specifically designed for bulk data operations.

By carefully considering these factors and implementing appropriate 
strategies, you can optimize Hibernate's performance for bulk processing 
scenarios, even though it may not be its strongest area.

- principles such as DI in spring 
Spring is a popular Java framework that adheres to several design principles. 
Here are some key principles, with a focus on dependency management:

1. Dependency Injection (DI):

?	Loose Coupling: DI promotes loose coupling between components by 
injecting dependencies into classes rather than having them create 
dependencies themselves. This makes the code more modular, testable, and 
maintainable.

?	Control Inversion: DI inverts the control flow, allowing the framework to 
create and manage dependencies. This provides greater flexibility and control 
over the application's components.

?	Configuration: Dependencies are configured using XML, annotations, or Java 
configuration classes. This makes it easy to manage and modify 
dependencies.
2. Inversion of Control (IoC):

?	Control Inversion: IoC is a fundamental principle in Spring that delegates 
control to the framework. This allows the framework to create and manage 
objects, making the application more flexible and testable.

?	Dependency Injection: DI is a specific implementation of IoC. By injecting 
dependencies, Spring takes control of object creation and management.

3. Convention over Configuration:

?	Reduced Boilerplate: Spring adopts a convention-over-configuration 
approach, meaning that it makes reasonable assumptions based on 

naming conventions and conventions. This reduces the amount of 
configuration required, making development faster and easier.

?	Simplified Development: By following conventions, developers can focus on 
writing business logic rather than spending time on configuration.

4. Modular Architecture:

?	Small, Focused Modules: Spring encourages the creation of small, focused 
modules that have well-defined responsibilities. This makes the application 
easier to understand, maintain, and test.

?	Dependency Management: Spring provides tools for managing 
dependencies between modules, ensuring that the application is well-
organized and scalable.

5. Testability:

?	Unit Testing: Spring's modular architecture and DI make it easy to write unit 
tests for individual components. This helps to ensure code quality and 
maintainability.

?	Mock Objects: Spring provides tools for creating mock objects, which can be 
used to isolate components and test them independently.

Dependency Management:

Spring's dependency management features are crucial for building modular 
and maintainable applications. Here are some key aspects:

?	Dependency Injection: Spring's DI mechanism allows you to inject 
dependencies into classes, making them independent of how those 
dependencies are created.

?	Dependency Injection Containers: Spring provides different dependency 
injection containers, such as the ApplicationContext, which manages the 
lifecycle of objects and their dependencies.

?	Dependency Management Tools: Spring integrates with dependency 
management tools like Maven or Gradle, making it easy to manage external 
dependencies.


?	Dependency Injection Annotations: Spring provides annotations like 
@Autowired, @Inject, and @Qualifier to configure dependencies declaratively.

By following these design principles and leveraging Spring's dependency 
management features, you can create well-structured, maintainable, and 
scalable Java applications.


- mongodb 
MongoDB: A NoSQL Database

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, 
document-oriented format. It's designed for scalability, performance, and ease 
of use, 
making it a great choice for a wide range of applications.

Key Features

?	Document-Oriented: Stores data in BSON documents, which are similar to 
JSON objects.

?	Schema-Less: While MongoDB supports schemas for validation and 
indexing, it is not strictly schema-bound, allowing for flexibility in data 
modeling.

?	Indexing: Supports various indexing techniques, including primary, secondary, 
and unique indexes, to improve query performance.

?	Aggregation Framework: Provides a 

powerful aggregation framework for performing complex data analysis and 
transformations.

?	Sharding: Can be scaled horizontally by sharding data across multiple 
servers.

?	Replication: Supports replication for data redundancy and fault tolerance.

Pros of MongoDB

?	Flexibility: The schema-less nature of MongoDB allows for easy data 
modeling and changes.

?	Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally to handle large datasets and 
high traffic.

?	Performance: It is optimized for 
performance, especially for read-heavy workloads.

?	Ease of Use: MongoDB has a relatively simple API and is easy to learn.

Cons of MongoDB

?	ACID Compliance: While MongoDB supports ACID compliance, it may not be 
as strict as traditional relational databases.

?	SQL Limitations: MongoDB's query language is not as powerful as SQL, 
especially for complex joins and aggregations.

?	Data Modeling Challenges: Designing efficient data models in MongoDB can 
be challenging, especially for complex 

relationships.

In conclusion, MongoDB is a versatile NoSQL database that is well-suited for 
a wide range of applications. Its flexibility, scalability, and performance make it 
a popular choice for modern development projects. However, it's important to 
consider its limitations and choose the right database for your specific needs.

ACID vs. MongoDB: A Comparison

ACID is a set of properties that ensure data integrity in a database:

?	Atomicity: A transaction is either fully committed or fully rolled back.
?	Consistency: A transaction must leave the database in a consistent state.

?	Isolation: Transactions must be isolated from each other, preventing 
interference.

?	Durability: Committed changes must be durable and persist even in the event 
of a system failure.

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that, while designed for scalability and 
performance, does not fully adhere to all ACID properties in the traditional 
sense. Here's why:

?	Eventual Consistency: MongoDB prioritizes availability and performance 
over strong consistency. It uses an eventual consistency model, where data 
changes may not be immediately visible to all reads. This means that a read 
operation might not return the most recent data immediately after a write 
operation.

?	Relaxed Isolation: MongoDB offers different isolation levels, but the default 
level is read uncommitted, which allows for dirty reads (reading data that has 
not yet been committed). This can lead to inconsistencies if not handled 
carefully.

?	Durability: MongoDB ensures durability through replication and sharding. 
However, in the event of a catastrophic failure, there might be a short period of 
data loss before recovery.

While MongoDB may not strictly adhere to ACID in the traditional sense, 
it offers 

strong guarantees for most use cases. By understanding its characteristics 
and limitations, developers can effectively use MongoDB for their applications.

For applications that require strong ACID guarantees, MongoDB may not 
be the best choice. In such cases, a traditional relational database like 
MySQL or PostgreSQL might be more suitable. However, for many modern 
applications, MongoDB's flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages 
outweigh the potential drawbacks of its relaxed ACID compliance.

SQL vs. NoSQL: A Comparison with Denormalization

SQL Databases
-	Relational: Data is organized into tables, rows, and columns, forming 
relationships between data elements.

?	Schema-based: Requires a predefined schema that defines the structure of 
the data, including data types, relationships, and constraints.

?	ACID Compliance: Adheres to the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, 
Isolation, Durability) for data integrity.

?	Denormalization: While SQL databases can denormalize data to improve 
performance, it's generally done with caution due to potential data redundancy 
and consistency issues.

NoSQL Databases

-	Non-Relational: Data is stored in various formats, such as key-value 
pairs, document-oriented, column-oriented, or graph-oriented.

?	Schema-less or Flexible: May not require a strict schema upfront, allowing 
for more flexibility in data modeling.

?	Denormalization: NoSQL databases often embrace denormalization as a 
core strategy to improve performance and reduce the number of joins required 
for queries.

?	ACID Compliance: May not fully adhere to ACID properties, especially in 
terms of consistency and isolation.

Denormalization: A Key Difference

Denormalization involves introducing redundancy into a database by 
duplicating data to improve query performance. While this can be beneficial in 
certain scenarios, it can also lead to data inconsistencies if not managed 
carefully.

?	SQL: Denormalization is generally avoided in SQL databases due to the risk 
of data inconsistencies and the need to maintain referential integrity.

?	NoSQL: Denormalization is often embraced in NoSQL databases, as they are 
designed to handle redundant data and prioritize performance over strict 
consistency.
When to Use Which

?	SQL: Suitable for applications that require complex joins, ACID compliance, 
and strong data integrity.

?	NoSQL: Suitable for applications that deal with large datasets, unstructured 
data, or need high scalability and performance, especially when 
denormalization can improve query performance.

In summary, the key difference between SQL and NoSQL databases lies in 
their approach to data modeling and denormalization. SQL databases prioritize 
data integrity and consistency, while NoSQL databases often embrace 
denormalization to improve performance and scalability. The choice between 
SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements of your application, 
including the type of data, performance needs, and data consistency 
requirements.

- Software Design Patterns 
Key Software Design Patterns

Software design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in 
software design. They provide proven templates that can be adapted to 
various contexts. Here are some of the most common and essential design 
patterns:

Creational Patterns

?	Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets 
subclasses decide which class to 
instantiate.

?	Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or 
dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.   

?	Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point 
of access to it.   

?	Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its 
representation, allowing the same construction process to create different 
representations.   

?	Prototype: Creates new objects by copying an existing object.   

Structural Patterns

-	Adapter: Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients 
expect.

?	Bridge: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, so the two can 
vary independently.

?	Composite: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole 
hierarchies.

?	Decorator: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

?	Facade: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.   

?	Flyweight: Reduces the number of objects by sharing common data.

?	Proxy: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control 
access to it.

Behavioral Patterns

?	Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes 
them interchangeable.

?	Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when 
one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated 
automatically.   

?	Iterator: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object 
sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

?	Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, 
deferring some steps to subclasses.   

?	Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you 
parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and 
support undoable operations.   

?	State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

?	Visitor: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object 
structure.

?	Memento: Captures and externalizes 
an object's internal state so that it can be restored to this state later.

These are just a few of the many design patterns that can be used to improve 
the structure, maintainability, and flexibility of your software. By understanding 
and applying these patterns, you can create more robust, scalable, and 
reusable code.

- software design principles 
Key Software Design Principles

Software design principles are guidelines that help developers create high-
quality, maintainable, and scalable code. Here are some of the most 
fundamental principles:

SOLID Principles
-	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one 
reason to change.

?	Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Entities should be open for extension but 
closed for modification.   

?	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be 
replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of 
the program.   

?	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to 
depend on interfaces they do not use.   

?	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not 
concretions.   

Other Important Principles

?	DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid duplication of code or logic.

?	KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Design solutions that are easy to understand 
and maintain.

?	YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Don't implement features until you actually 
need them.

?	Separation of Concerns: Divide a system into distinct parts based on their 
functionality.

?	Modularity: Break down a system into smaller, self-contained modules.


?	Encapsulation: Hide the internal implementation details of a class from other 
classes.

?	Abstraction: Create higher-level models of complex systems.

?	Polymorphism: Allow objects of different types to be treated as if they were of 
the same type.

?	Cohesion: Ensure that a class or module has a single, well-defined purpose.

?	Coupling: Minimize the dependencies between different parts of a system.

By following these principles, you can create software that is easier to 
understand, maintain, and extend.

1. Benefits of separation between DTO and domain objects 

Benefits of Separating DTOs and Domain Objects

Separating Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from Domain Objects in your 
application architecture offers several significant advantages:

1. Improved Modularity and Maintainability:

-	Decoupling: DTOs act as intermediaries, decoupling the presentation 
layer (e.g., web UI, REST API) from the domain layer. This separation 
makes it easier to modify one layer without affecting the other.

?	Reduced Coupling: Changes to the domain model (e.g., adding or removing 
fields) have a minimal impact on the presentation layer, as long as the DTOs 
are updated accordingly.

2. Enhanced Security:

?	Data Filtering: DTOs can be used to selectively expose only the necessary 
data to the presentation layer, preventing sensitive information from being 
leaked.


?	Input Validation: DTOs can be validated before being mapped to domain 
objects, ensuring that incoming data is valid and secure.

3. Optimized Performance:

?	Reduced Data Transfer: By using DTOs, you can transfer only the required 
data, reducing network traffic and improving performance.

?	Efficient Mapping: DTOs can be designed to optimize mapping to and from 
domain objects, leading to faster data transfer.

4. Better Testability:
Isolated Testing: DTOs can be tested independently from the domain layer, 
making testing easier and more efficient.

?	Mockable Objects: DTOs can be easily mocked for unit testing purposes, 
simplifying the testing process.

5. Improved Code Readability:

?	Clear Separation of Concerns: The separation between DTOs and domain 
objects makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

?	Enhanced Maintainability: By having distinct responsibilities, the code 
becomes easier to maintain and modify over time.

In summary, separating DTOs and domain objects provides a more modular, 
secure, performant, testable, and readable application architecture. It is a 
common practice in modern software development, especially when dealing 
with complex systems and large-scale applications.

- performance metrics 

Throughput, Latency, and Other Performance Metrics

When evaluating the performance of a system, several key metrics are often 
considered. Here are some of the most common:

Throughput


?	Definition: The rate at which a system can process data or requests.

?	Units: Typically measured in requests per second (RPS), bytes per second 
(B/s), or operations per second (OPS).

?	Example: A web server with a throughput of 1000 RPS can handle 1000 
requests per second.

Latency

?	Definition: The time it takes for a request to be processed and a response to 
be returned.

?	Units: Typically measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs).

-	Example: A web server with a latency of 100 ms takes 100 milliseconds 
to process a request and return a response.

Other Related Metrics

?	Response Time: The total time elapsed from when a request is sent to when 
a response is received, including network latency.

?	Concurrency: The number of simultaneous requests a system can handle.

?	Utilization: The percentage of a system's resources (CPU, memory, network) 
that are being used.
?	Error Rate: The percentage of requests that result in errors.

?	Availability: The percentage of time a system is operational and accessible.

The Relationship Between Throughput and Latency

?	Inverse Relationship: Generally, there is an inverse relationship between 
throughput and latency. As throughput increases, latency may also increase 
due to resource contention and queuing.

?	Balancing Act: The goal is to optimize both throughput and latency to achieve 
the desired performance characteristics for a system.


Factors Affecting Performance

?	Hardware: The speed and capacity of hardware components (e.g., CPU, 
memory, storage) significantly impact performance.

?	Software: The efficiency of the software code and algorithms can affect 
performance.

?	Network: Network latency and bandwidth can impact the overall response 
time.

?	Load: The number and type of requests a system is handling can affect its 
performance.

By understanding these metrics and the 
factors that influence them, you can effectively measure and improve the 
performance of your systems.
